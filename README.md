### Guided Reading app prototype

This is a high-fidelity, funtional prototype of a guided reading app for middle-school aged aspiring readers, presented to and sponsored by Scholastic Inc. Middle school students are able to choose reading by swiping through previews of articles. The text is broken into manageable chunks, and a buddy encourages them and guides them through assessment. They are able to highlight content and then review their highlighted content for the final open-ended assessment.
